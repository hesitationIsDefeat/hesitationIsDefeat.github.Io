## WELCOME

I'm Onat, a Maths student in Boğaziçi University in Turkey, and here is me:

### My Interests


#### Physical exercises
I've played Basketball over 9 years. Currently I'm interested in calisthenics, running, HIIT trainings and yoga. 

#### Gaming
I've been a huge fan of gaming ever since I was a kid. Even though I don't have that much time to spare for gaming, the spirit still lives inside of me.

#### Music
I'm a big time listenner (if that is a thing) and a guitar player. My taste for music deviated from soft rock to rock and from rock to metal over the years but I adore any kind of it. Here are those [astonishing playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/onattanriover?si=6a92838856a540e1())! 

#### Coding
My journey with coding began around 7 years ago, with an elementary course on coding. Later on I've worked mainly with Python, Java and C# and a little bit of R. Most of my learnings came from my self-studies during my spare time and I highly enjoy learning anything new.

#### Socializing
I'm surrounded with amazing people and socializing with them provides me with positivity and joy.

#### Drawing
I love drawing in black and white and I love tattoos, just looking at them is amazing. What is the most amazing, though, is BLACK AND WHITE TATTOOS.

#### Travelling
Travelling to places I've never been before always comes with brand new and unforgettable experiences.
