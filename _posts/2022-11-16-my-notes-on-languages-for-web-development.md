Here are my notes from the Fullstack Engineering Course of [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/):

- An HTML element looks as such:

```HTML
<p>SupYall</p>
```

It consists of an opening tag, the content and a closing tag, where the closing tag includes a backslash

```HTML
<h1> h1 is used for text <h1>
<p> p is used for a paragraph <p>
<a> a is used for links (I suppose) <a>
<button> button <button> is for creating a button (surprisingly enough)
```

attribute: it has a name and a value like width = "146.2"
href (hyperlink reference) attribute: adds an url

```HTML
<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr8J6oYSI_U">This</a> is now linked to the given url
```

functions: reusable code blocks that does something (anything!)
events: makes the page react to user inputs
how it works is simply as follows:

```HTML
<html>

    <script>
        function doNothing() {}
    </script>

    <body>
        <button onclick = "doNothing"> CLICK ME! </button>
    </body>
</html>
```
We defined our function doNothing(), which does nothing, in the script part since it is a JavaScript code. Then we assigned this function to the onclick value of a button we created and voila. Clicking this button will trigger the function and make our code reactable by the users. 

SQL (structured query language): stores the data
