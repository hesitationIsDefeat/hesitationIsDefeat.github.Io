Here are my notes from the Fullstack Engineering Course of [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/):

- An HTML element looks as such:

```HTML
<p>SupYall</p>
```

It consists of an opening tag, the content and a closing tag, where the closing tag includes a backslash

<h1> h1 is used for text <h1>
<p> p is used for a paragraph <p>
<a> a is used for links (I suppose) <a>
<button> button <button> is for creating a button (surprisingly enough)
- attribute: it has a name and a value like width = "146.2"
- href (hyperlink reference) attribute: adds an url
To see it in action, you can click <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr8J6oYSI_U">here</a> to check out if it works
