Here are my notes from the Fullstack Engineering Course of [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/):

filesystem commands:
- ls: Lists the items in the current directory.
- pwd: Prints the name of the current directory.
- cd: Changes directory. If a directory name is passed as an arguemnt, it switches to that directory. if ".." is passed as an argument, it moves up one diirectory. It is also possible to pass a relative path as an argument like ../.. or resources/photos.
- mkdir: Takes a name as an argument and creates a new directory in the current one.
- touch: Takes a name as an argument and creates a new file in the current directory.
- clear: Clears the terminal.
- Arrow keys can be used to navigate b/w the past commands.
- echo: Can be used in the format "input" >> newfile.txt. Creates a new file and with the provided input in it.
- cat: Prints the contents of a file.
